# datahub

You want to develop some Python code to connect with the API of the SAC Hub.


Code is developed with Python version 3.7.1 through an Anaconda installation.


Dependencies (i.e. packages / modules used):
- oauthlib            (version 3.0.0)
- requests-oauthlib   (version 1.0.0)
- requests            (version 2.21.0)
- logging             (version 0.5.1.2)
- pandas              (version 0.23.4)
- time
- datetime


To do:
- Understand which Python package we need to use!!!
- Create Python code to test the link with the API.
- Create Python code to perform a GET request to the API.
- Investigate how you can get a token for the code.
- Investigate how you receive the X-CSRF-Token from the initial GET request.
- Create Python code to perform a POST request to the API
